        <p class = "generictext">The Raisbeck Rocketry team competes in the American Rocketry Challenge which is an event where teams build their own rockets and try to get them to reach a specific altitude and land within an allotted time frame.  Our work throughout the season includes designing rockets using computer simulations, manufacturing a prototype, and launching then revising that prototype. Our goal this year is to build a rocket capable of qualifying for nationals. We also are looking into the possibility of making 3d printed rockets. If you love launching rockets, engineering and building things, or 3d modeling, then the Rocketry Team is for you.</p>        </section>
